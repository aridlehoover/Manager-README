# Hello. I’m Alan.

Welcome to the team! I’m super excited that you joined us!

Before we get started, I’d like to share a bit about my management style and expectations. This is not intended to be exhaustive. And, it is absolutely not intended to replace any face-to-face conversations between us. It’s just my README: an introduction to me with examples of how to use some of my common APIs.

## What can you expect of me as your manager?

My role is to ensure the success of our team. I define success as a combination of happiness, career growth, and adding value to the organization. Specifically:

1. I am here to help you improve your technical skills, grow your career, and enjoy your work.
2. I am here to provide context and to [align](https://thinkgrowth.org/what-elon-musk-taught-me-about-growing-a-business-c2c173f5bff3) our team with the rest of the company.
3. I am here to ensure the team is getting what we need from other teams, and vice versa.
4. I am also here to write some code.

These are in rough order of prioritization. If you aren't successful and happy, our team is not successful (or happy). If our team is struggling, I probably will not be doing much coding.

Also, I may be accountable for the decisions made by the team, but I should not be the one making most of the decisions. That’s why you’re here.

### One on Ones

We will have a weekly, 30-minute one-on-one (unless you prefer a different cadence). This will be a private, safe space where we can reflect and plan. I will likely have things to discuss. But, this is your meeting. I defer to your agenda. In fact, I recommend that you jot down some notes before the meeting. Slack them to me ahead of time, if you want. I’ll do my best to prepare beforehand.

## Guiding Principles

I have three guiding principles for our team:

- No Superpeople. If one of us does all the heavy lifting, the rest of us won’t develop any muscles.
- No cowboys. We need to be aligned on design principles and architectural approaches.
- No surprizes. We should be the first to know when there is a problem.

## What do I expect of you?

I expect that you will think deeply, play nice, and pay it forward.

### Think Deeply

As software engineers, we are paid to think. But, I know from personal experience how easy it is to lose sight of things outside your editor. So, I invite you to think deeply about all aspects of your work, not just the code.

- Understand what you are building and why.
- Consider who you are doing it for and what their needs are.
- Task out your work.
- Put yourself in the shoes of an engineer reading your code and tests months from now.
- Understand the trade-offs you are making in your design decisions.
- Pay attention when your tests are hard to write.
- Explore the unhappy paths.
- Ask yourself what “done” really means.
- Daydream about how to make everything better.

Above all, think!

### Play Nice

Software development is a team sport. In order to meet our goals, we’re going to need to collaborate. To get there we need kindness, communication, and alignment.

Be kind to each other — especially when things go wrong. Your kindness will create a safe space for open and honest communication. Once we’re communicating, we can align ourselves around a shared purpose. Doing so will foster collaboration.

### Pay It Forward

Mentoring is the act of paying forward the time and energy that others invested in you on your way to where you are today. It is a force multiplier. It magnifies the contributions you make through the actions of those you mentor.

I expect the entire team to mentor one another no matter seniority, experience, or proficiency, because you will never learn something more quickly than when you sit down to teach it to someone else. There are many ways to mentor. Here are a few ideas to start:

- Write some documentation
- Host a brown-bag
- Get involved in a guild
- Thoughtfully review a pull request
- Sit with another engineer and work on a problem together

Mentoring isn’t hard. And, it’s not about who knows the most. I’ve mentored many people with better technical skills than mine by being open to sharing what I do know. And, I learn from people with less experience than me every day by being open to learning  all the time.

## Feedback

I love learning. And, as hard as it is sometimes, I find personal growth to be extremely rewarding. So, if you have feedback for me, be it praise or criticism, please share it in whatever way works best for you (in person, in writing, through my manager, during a 360 review, etc.). You have my promise, I’ll listen and do my best to learn from it and grow.

I will provide you feedback during our one-on-ones in the same spirit of learning and growth. My feedback will be both positive and constructive. In the unlikely event that there is an issue with your performance, I will let you know in the safety of a one-on-one where we can work on a plan together.

## Schedule

I am usually in the office from 10am to 6pm. I’m often there later, but rarely earlier. That way I get to see my kids off to school and miss the traffic. Most nights, I get back online after my kids are in bed to plan the next day. So, it’s not uncommon to find me on Slack after 10pm. What can I say? I’m a night person.

As for your schedule, do what works for you around the team’s core hours of 10am to 5pm.  We have core hours in order to take maximum advantage of the high bandwidth communication channel created by sitting next to each other.

That said, there are times when I need to leave earlier than 5pm in order to take care of my kids or arrive later than 10am so I can visit the dentist. This is my life. I expect yours has similar requirements. All I ask is that if you are going to be unavailable during core hours, please add the time to our out-of-office calendar and let the team know.

### Working from Home

As a general rule, I prefer that people work together in the office as much as possible. As I aluded to above, I prefer this because communicating in person has a much higher signal to noise ratio that other forms of communication.

Of course, there will be times when it makes sense for one or the other of us to work from home. I will do my best to plan and communicate this with the team before hand. And, as much as possible, I’ll open a Slack video chat that you can drop into to talk to me face-to-face. I would appreciate it if you did the same.

## Personality quirks

I have been told that I can come across as having very strong opinions. That’s because I do. So, be prepared to challenge me when your idea is better than mine. Show me a better way, and I will likely change my position and argue just as strongly for yours.

I also have a tendency to blurt out some version of “no” before really considering the question. It’s a bad habit. I’m working on squelching it. In the meantime, just be prepared to wait a minute while I process the idea. Often, I’ll change my answer within moments as I think it through.

## Where to focus during your first 90 days?

It depends on your background and experience. If you are joining the team as an Associate Software Engineer, you’ll go through a formal 30/60/90 plan that focuses on growing your technical skills. If you’re joining the team as a Software Engineer or above, your first 90 days will be about exploring the codebase and learning our development practices. In either case, expect to work closely with your teammates as they show you around.

Also, if you haven’t already, I highly recommend that you read these books:

- [Practical Object Oriented Development in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/) by Sandi Metz
- [Extreme Programming Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) by Kent Beck
- [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) by Kim Scott

These are my guideposts for how to write and test object-oriented software, how to run a software development team, and how to manage people.

## Welcome!

Again, welcome to the team! Now, let's get started!
