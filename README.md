# Hello. I’m Alan.

Welcome to my README! This document is an introduction to me and my management style. It is not meant to be exhaustive; nor is it meant to replace face-to-face conversations between us. It's just my README: an introduction with some examples of how to to interact with my management API.

## What is my role?

At a high level, my role is to ensure the success of our team. I define success as a combination of happiness, career growth, and adding value to the organization. Specifically:

1. I am here to help you improve your technical skills, grow your career, and enjoy your work.
2. I am here to provide context and to [align](https://thinkgrowth.org/what-elon-musk-taught-me-about-growing-a-business-c2c173f5bff3) our team with the rest of the organization.
3. I am here to represent the team, ensure the team is getting what we need from other teams, and vice versa.
4. I am also here to (occasionally) write some code.

These are in rough order of prioritization. If you aren't successful and happy, then our team is not successful (or happy). If our team is struggling, I probably won't be writing much code.

## Guiding Principles

I have three guiding principles for our team:

- **No superheroes.**<br>If one of us does all the heavy lifting, the rest of us won’t develop any muscles.

- **No cowboys.**<br>We need to be aligned on principles, processes, and approaches.

- **No surprises.**<br>We should be the first to know when there is a problem.

## What are my expectations?

Beyond the guiding principles, which I view as table stakes for our team, I expect thoughtfulness, collaboration, mentorship, and agility.

### Thoughtfulness

As software engineers, we are paid to think. But, I know from personal experience how easy it is to lose sight of things outside your editor. So, I invite you to think deeply about all aspects of your work, not just the code.

- Understand what you are building and why
- Consider who you are doing it for and what their needs are
- Task out your work
- Put yourself in the shoes of an engineer reading your code and tests months from now
- Understand the trade-offs you are making in your design decisions
- Pay attention when your tests are hard to write
- Explain why a test is important by naming it well
- Explore the unhappy paths
- Ask yourself what “done” really means
- Daydream about how to make everything better

Above all, think!

### Collaboration

Software development is a team sport. In order to meet our goals, we’re going to need to collaborate both within our team, and with other teams. To get there we need kindness, communication, and alignment.

Be kind to one other — especially when things go wrong. Your kindness will create a trusting, safe space for open and honest communication. Once we’re communicating, we can align ourselves around a shared purpose. Doing so will foster collaboration.

Here are a few ways we can collaborate:

- Clarify user story requirements during our planning meeting
- State what's blocking you during our daily standup (or before then!)
- Whiteboard designs with your teammates prior to working on a story
- Actively participate in retrospectives
- Thoughtfully review a pull request
- Sit with another engineer and work on a problem together

### Mentorship

Mentoring is the act of paying forward the time and energy that others invested in you on your way to where you are today. It is a force multiplier. It magnifies the contributions you make through the actions of those you mentor.

I expect the entire team to mentor one another no matter seniority, experience, or proficiency, because you will never learn something more quickly than when you sit down to teach it to someone else.

There are many ways to mentor. Here are a few ideas to start:

- Write a commit message that explains why, not what
- Document some code with tests
- Host a brown-bag
- Get involved in a guild
- Kindly provide feedback in person
- Sit with another engineer and work on a problem together

Mentoring isn’t hard. And, it’s not about who knows the most. I’ve mentored many people with more advanced technical skills than mine by being open to sharing what I do know. And, I learn from people with less experience than me every day by being open to learning all the time.

### Agility

Every software development team is unique. As such, every team needs to discover together the practices that work best for them. But, there are industry-wide best practices which the vast majority of teams should be using. And, there are other practices that have proved quite useful to me during my career.

My expectation here is that we will work together to discover the practices that work best for our team, and that we will reflect and learn and apply our learnings along the way.

For more on this topic, I've created a separate document, [here](AGILITY.md).

## Feedback

I love learning. And, as hard as it is sometimes, I find personal growth to be extremely rewarding. I sincerely hope we share this gene.

### One on Ones
We will have weekly one-on-one meetings. This will be a private, safe space where we can reflect and plan. I will often have things to discuss. But, this is your meeting. I defer to your agenda. In fact, I recommend that you jot down some notes before the meeting. Send them to me ahead of time, if you want. I’ll do my best to prepare beforehand.

### Giving Me Feedback

If you have feedback for me, be it praise or criticism, please share it in whatever way works best for you (in person, in writing, through my manager, during a 360 review, etc.). You have my promise, I’ll listen and do my best to learn from it and grow.

### Receiving Feedback from Me

I will provide you feedback in the same spirit of learning and growth. More often than not, my feedback will be positive. Sometimes it will be critical. I will work hard to ensure that it is always constructive. In the unlikely event that there is an issue with your performance, I will let you know in the private safety of a one-on-one where we can work on a plan together.

## Schedule

I am usually in the office from 10am to 6pm. I’m often there later, but rarely earlier. That way I get to see my kids off to school and miss the traffic. Most nights, I get back online to plan the next day after my kids are in bed. So, it’s not uncommon to find me online after 10pm. What can I say? I’m a night person.

As for your schedule, do what works for you around the team’s core hours of 10am to 5pm. We have core hours in order to take maximum advantage of the high bandwidth communication channel created by sitting next to each other.

That said, there are times when I need to leave earlier than 5pm in order to take care of my kids or arrive later than 10am so I can visit the dentist. This is my life. I expect yours has similar constraints. All I ask is that if you are going to be unavailable during core hours, please put it on your calendar and let me and the team know.

### Working from Home

As a general rule, I prefer that people work together in the office as much as possible. As I alluded to above, I prefer this because communicating in person has a much higher signal to noise ratio that other forms of communication.

Of course, there will be times when it makes sense for one or the other of us to work from home. I will do my best to plan and communicate this with the team before hand. And, as much as possible, I’ll be available via video chat for you to drop in to and talk to me face-to-face. I would appreciate it if you did the same.

## Recommended reading

If you haven’t already, I highly recommend that you read these books:

- [Practical Object Oriented Development in Ruby](http://www.poodr.com/) by Sandi Metz
- [Extreme Programming Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) by Kent Beck
- [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) by Kim Scott

These are my guideposts for how to write and test object-oriented software, how to run a software development team, and how to manage people.

## Personality quirks

Finally, I have a couple of quirks that are helpful to understand.

The first is that I can come across as having very strong opinions. That’s because I do. So, be prepared to challenge me when your idea is better than mine. Show me a better way, and I will likely change my position and argue just as strongly for yours.

Second is that I bring my whole self to work. I can be emotional. In a good way. I've been known to tear up &mdash; especially when giving praise. Honestly, I find it embarrassing, but I've learned to embrace it because that's who I am. I care deeply. And, sometimes it comes out in ways I cannot control.

I mention these things here as a way of helping you better understand me. You'll undoubtedly see these quirks in action. Now you'll know what to expect.

## Welcome!

We'll make time to get to know each other better in person as we work together. But, for now, that's it. That's me in a nutshell. I'm glad you're on the team. Now, let's do something amazing together!
